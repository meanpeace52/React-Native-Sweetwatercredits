            About Sage-Grouse Mitigation Credits
          </Text>

          <Text style={bodyText}>
            The SRC Wyoming Sage-grouse Mitigation Credit Estimator (SGMCE) estimates the number of credits needed to offset the impact of a proposed action that cannot be avoided or minimized, so that project permitting can proceed.  However, the app output is an estimate until the appropriate regulatory body (state and/or federal) has verified that input values for a project are accurate according to state and federal requirements.
          </Text>

          <Text style={bodyText}>
            SGMCE estimates the number of credits that meet the standard of the Wyoming Credit Definition in the Wyoming Greater Sage-grouse Compensatory Mitigation Framework, that are required to offset the impact of a project.   The Wyoming Credit definition sets a rigorous biological and policy-compliant standard for credits that ensures impacts to sage-grouse are offset in a manner that benefits greater sage-grouse and the Wyoming Core Area Strategyâ€”while simultaneously providing for economic development in Wyoming.

          <Text style={bodyText}>
            SRC credits not only meet the highest standard of the Wyoming Credit Definition (SRC meets all mandatory requirements, has no discounted factors, and SRC credits include a landscape support additional valuation); SRC credits also include the additional benefit of being from a USFWS Approved Conservation Bank.   USFWS Approved the SRC Greater Sage-Grouse Habitat Conservation Bank in December of 2014.

          <Text style={bodyText}>
            It is uncertain if the USFWS will continue to approve conservation banks for Greater sage-grouse since the species was not listed in 2015.   The Wyoming Credit Definition is rigorous and appropriate for mitigating impacts, and incorporates many of the requirements of a USFWS approved Conservation Bank.  However, that notwithstanding, only SRC has USFWS approved credits.  The potential importance of such an approval as an assurance to a project proponent is noteworthy for Section 7 and other potential regulatory requirements if sage-grouse were to become a candidate or listed species in the future.   USFWS has committed to conducting another status review in 2020 to determine if greater sage-grouse warrant listing.
